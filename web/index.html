<h1> PLEASE INDICATE YOUR TRUST </h1>
<p><a href="https://192.168.254.107/index-ww2.html">Click here to be routed to an Apache 2 server</a> that will render the WeBWorK2 exercises on the pages of this site when "Activate"ed.  The server only has a root-signed server certificate (and no CA-signed certificate for now).  Click on <b>"PROCEED ANYWAY"</b> if you're willing to trust me (and the server, of course).</p>

<br/>
<h2> Alternative </h2>
<p>Alternatively, one may access the pages without a functional "Activate" button (i.e., without access to an online WeBWork2 server) through this <a href="https://justineuroptx.github.io/ww2-collegeAlgebra-exers/index-ww2.html">web page (ww2-collegeAlgebra-exers)</a>.</p>
